He is also a resident DJ at club HALL.

In 2017 Artur had the honor of being a resident DJ in Berlin, at an event called Techno Mittwoch that takes place at a club named AVA. Currently he is associated with club HALL. You can find him regularly performing from warm-up sessions to prime time and often ending HALL clubnights on Sundays.

If you have seen him DJ, you have experienced that he will glue the dancefloor together to take everyone onto a journey and is not afraid to mix up his sets with other genres of music that fit with his style. With a decade of experience performing at illegal raves, festivals and club scenes mostly across the Baltic States, Finland and Russia. With his extensive knowledge he knows how important it is to keep a certain mood on the dance-floor and how to adapt to different circumstances.
